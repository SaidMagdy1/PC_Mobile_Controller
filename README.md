In Linux, the & symbol is used to run a command in the background. Hereâ€™s why you might use it:

Reasons to Use &
Non-blocking Execution: 
     When you append & to a command, it allows that command to run in the background while you continue using the terminal. This means you can execute other commands without waiting for the previous one to finish.
Multiple Processes: You can start multiple processes simultaneously. For example, if you want to open several applications or run multiple scripts at once, using & lets you do that without having to open multiple terminal windows.
